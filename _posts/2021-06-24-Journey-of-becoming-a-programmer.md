ORIGIN STORY
I was an Assistant Knowledge Manager working at one of the BIG4, earning a decent amount every month, great benefits and amazing co-workers. 
When COVID-19 hit and we were send to work from home, it hit me 
- I was not entirely satisfied with a 9-5 office job and I realised that I wanted more and the flexibility to work from home or even remotly from anywhere in the world.

I'm glad you are here! :) 
I like to take you on an exciting and interesting journey with me. A journey of me quitting a well-paid job in order to build up my art studio and to become a professional programmer. 

WHY art studio and programming? 
Well, art has always been a part of my life and I belive that programming and art are kind of similar, in both ways you work in the role of a creator. Especially, when we think about NFT's the borders become blurred.
